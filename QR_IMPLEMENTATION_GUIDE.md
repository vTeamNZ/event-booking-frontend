# QR Code Organizer Functionality - Implementation Guide

## Overview
I've successfully implemented the "Reserve tickets without payments" functionality for organizers that generates QR codes using your QR code service. Here's what has been added:

## New Features

### 1. QR Code Generation for Organizers
- Added a new green "Generate QR Tickets (Organizer Only)" button in the Payment page
- This button is only visible to authenticated users with "Organizer" role
- Uses the organizer's name and email for ticket generation
- Generates unique GUIDs for each ticket
- Supports both seat-based and ticket-based bookings

### 2. Enhanced Payment Success Page
- Updated to handle QR ticket generation success
- Shows detailed information about generated tickets
- Displays status for each seat (Generated/Already Existed)
- Maintains existing functionality for regular payments and reservations

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`src/pages/Payment.tsx`**
   - Added import for `qrCodeService`
   - Added `handleGenerateQRTickets()` function
   - Added new QR ticket generation button for organizers
   - Implemented seat number generation logic for different booking types

2. **`src/pages/PaymentSuccess.tsx`**
   - Added support for QR ticket success state
   - Enhanced UI to show generated ticket details
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing flows

3. **`src/services/qrCodeService.ts`**
   - Updated API URL to use environment variable
   - Added fallback URL for development
   - Service ready for QR code generation

4. **Environment Files**
   - **`.env`**: Added `REACT_APP_QR_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5075`
   - **`.env.development`**: Added `REACT_APP_QR_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5075`
   - **`.env.production`**: Added `REACT_APP_QR_API_BASE_URL=https://kiwilanka.co.nz:5075`

5. **`qr-test.js`** (New file)
   - Simple test script to verify QR API connectivity
   - Updated to use environment variable

## How It Works

### For Organizers:
1. Navigate to any event and select tickets/seats
2. Proceed to Payment page
3. Fill in customer details (or use your own)
4. Click "Generate QR Tickets (Organizer Only)" button
5. System will:
   - Use organizer's fullName as firstName
   - Use organizer's email as both buyerEmail and organizerEmail
   - Generate unique GUID for paymentGUID
   - Create seat numbers based on selection
   - Call QR Code Generator API for each seat
   - Handle duplicates gracefully
6. Navigate to success page with QR ticket details

### Seat Number Generation Logic:
- **Seat-based bookings**: Uses actual selected seat numbers (e.g., "B5", "C12")
- **Ticket-based bookings**: Generates sequential seat numbers starting from "A1"

## Testing the Implementation

### Prerequisites:
1. Ensure QR Code Generator API is running on port 5075
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\user\source\repos\vTeamNZ\eTickets\QRCodeApps\QRCodeGeneratorAPI\QRCodeGeneratorAPI
   dotnet run
   ```

2. Ensure the main EventBooking API is running

3. Ensure the frontend is running
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\user\source\repos\vTeamNZ\event-booking-frontend
   npm start
   ```

### Test Steps:
1. **Test QR API connectivity**:
   ```bash
   node qr-test.js
   ```

2. **Test in browser**:
   - Login as an organizer
   - Navigate to any event
   - Select tickets or seats
   - Proceed to payment
   - Use the "Generate QR Tickets" button
   - Verify success page shows ticket details

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Button only visible to organizers
- ✅ Uses organizer's information for ticket generation
- ✅ Generates unique GUIDs
- ✅ Handles duplicate prevention
- ✅ Shows success feedback
- ✅ Maintains existing payment flows

## Error Handling
- API connection errors are displayed to user
- Duplicate tickets are handled gracefully
- Missing organizer information shows clear error messages
- Network issues provide helpful feedback

## Future Enhancements
1. **Organizer Email Lookup**: Currently uses organizer's own email. Could be enhanced to fetch the actual event organizer's email from the database.
2. **Bulk QR Generation**: Could add batch processing for large ticket quantities.
3. **Email Integration**: Could send generated tickets via email automatically.
4. **Download QR Codes**: Could add functionality to download generated QR codes as files.

## Notes
- The legacy "Reserve without Payment" button is still available and labeled as "(Legacy)"
- All existing payment flows remain unchanged
- QR ticket generation is completely separate from payment processing
- Uses the existing authentication and authorization system
