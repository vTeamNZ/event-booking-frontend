# Clear Selection Button Enhancement

## Change Summary

**Issue**: The "Clear Selection" button was always enabled, even when no seats were selected, which could confuse users.

**Solution**: Updated the button to only be enabled when there are actually seats selected to clear.

## Changes Made

### 1. SeatingSummary Component (`src/components/seating-v2/SeatingSummary.tsx`)

**Before:**
```tsx
<button
  onClick={onClear}
  className="flex-1 px-4 py-2 rounded-md transition-colors text-gray-700 bg-gray-100 hover:bg-gray-200"
>
  Clear Selection
</button>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<button
  onClick={onClear}
  disabled={!hasSelectedSeats}
  className={`flex-1 px-4 py-2 rounded-md transition-colors ${
    hasSelectedSeats
      ? 'text-gray-700 bg-gray-100 hover:bg-gray-200'
      : 'text-gray-400 bg-gray-50 cursor-not-allowed'
  }`}
>
  Clear Selection
</button>
```

### 2. SeatingLayoutV2 Component (`src/components/seating-v2/SeatingLayoutV2.tsx`)

Added early return in `handleClearSelection` function:
```tsx
// Early return if no seats are selected
if (selectionState.selectedSeats.length === 0) {
  toast('No seats selected to clear', { icon: 'ℹ️' });
  return;
}
```

## Behavior

### ✅ **When No Seats Selected:**
- "Clear Selection" button is **disabled** (grayed out)
- "Continue to Checkout" button is **disabled** (grayed out)
- If somehow clicked, shows informative message: "No seats selected to clear"

### ✅ **When Seats Are Selected:**
- "Clear Selection" button is **enabled** (gray background, hover effects)
- "Continue to Checkout" button is **enabled** (blue background)
- Clicking "Clear Selection" releases all seats and refreshes layout

## UI States

| Seats Selected | Clear Selection Button | Continue to Checkout Button |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| 0 seats        | ❌ Disabled (gray)    | ❌ Disabled (gray)          |
| 1+ seats       | ✅ Enabled (gray)     | ✅ Enabled (blue)           |

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users can clearly see when actions are available
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Both buttons follow the same enable/disable logic
3. **Visual Clarity**: Disabled state provides clear visual feedback
4. **Prevents Confusion**: No accidental clicks on non-functional buttons
5. **Accessibility**: Proper disabled state for screen readers

## Testing

**Test Scenarios:**
1. ✅ Load page with no seats selected → both buttons disabled
2. ✅ Select a seat → both buttons enabled  
3. ✅ Deselect all seats → both buttons disabled again
4. ✅ Use "Clear Selection" → all seats released, buttons disabled
5. ✅ Try to click disabled "Clear Selection" → no action, shows info message

This enhancement improves the overall user experience by providing clear visual feedback about available actions.
