# Free Food Items Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds support for free food items (price = $0) with the following requirements:
- Hide +/- buttons for items with price === 0
- Show them as "Free" but make them non-interactive
- Auto-add them (one per each ticket/seat) to the order without requiring user interaction

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. FoodSelectionEnhanced.tsx
**Auto-addition of free items:**
- Modified the food items fetch effect to automatically add free items to all seats/tickets
- Free items are set to quantity 1 per seat/ticket when loaded

**UI Changes:**
- Free items display "FREE" instead of price
- Added "Auto-included" badge for free items
- Removed +/- buttons for free items
- Show "Included with your order" message instead of quantity controls

**Logic Updates:**
- `handleFoodChange()` prevents modification of free items
- `applyGlobalSelections()` preserves free items when applying global selections
- `clearAllSelections()` preserves free items when clearing other selections

#### 2. FoodSelection.tsx
**Auto-addition of free items:**
- Modified food items fetch to auto-add free items with quantity 1

**UI Changes:**
- Free items display "FREE" with green styling
- Added "Auto-included" badge
- Removed +/- buttons for free items
- Show "Included with order" message

**Logic Updates:**
- `handleFoodQuantityChange()` prevents modification of free items

#### 3. ManageFoodItems.tsx
**Validation Updates:**
- Changed price validation from `> 0` to `>= 0` to allow $0 prices
- Updated error message to only prevent negative prices

### Backend Changes

#### 1. CheckoutModels.cs
**Validation Updates:**
- Changed `FoodLineItem.UnitPrice` validation from `[Range(0.01, double.MaxValue)]` to `[Range(0.00, double.MaxValue)]`
- This allows $0 food items to pass through the checkout process

## Features

### Auto-Addition Behavior
- When food items are loaded, any items with `price === 0` are automatically added to all seats/tickets
- Each seat/ticket gets exactly 1 of each free item
- This happens automatically without user interaction

### UI Behavior for Free Items
- **Display:** Shows "FREE" instead of price with green styling
- **Badge:** "Auto-included" badge to indicate automatic inclusion
- **Controls:** No +/- buttons (non-interactive)
- **Status:** Shows "Included with your order" message
- **Quantity:** Displays current quantity (always 1) but doesn't allow changes

### Protected Operations
- **Individual Changes:** Users cannot modify quantities of free items
- **Global Apply:** When applying global food selections, free items are preserved
- **Clear All:** When clearing all selections, free items remain at quantity 1

### Organizer Features
- **Creation:** Organizers can now create food items with $0 price
- **Validation:** Only prevents negative prices, allows $0
- **Management:** Free items appear in the manage food items list like regular items

## Testing Scenarios

### To Test Free Food Items:
1. **Database Setup:** Manually set food item price to 0 in database
2. **Load Food Selection:** Navigate to food selection page
3. **Verify Auto-Addition:** Free items should appear with quantity 1
4. **Verify UI:** Should show "FREE", "Auto-included" badge, no +/- buttons
5. **Verify Protection:** Try global operations - free items should remain

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Free items auto-added on page load
- ✅ Free items show as "FREE" with special styling
- ✅ No +/- buttons for free items
- ✅ Free items protected during clear/global operations
- ✅ Free items included in final order
- ✅ Backend accepts $0 food items in checkout

## Technical Notes

### Implementation Details:
- Free items are identified by `item.price === 0`
- Auto-addition happens in `useEffect` after fetching food items
- UI conditionally renders based on `isFree` boolean
- Function guards prevent modification of free items
- Backend validation allows $0.00 minimum price

### Edge Cases Handled:
- Loading state: Free items added after items load
- Global mode: Free items preserved when applying to all
- Clear all: Free items preserved when clearing selections
- Individual modification: Blocked for free items
- Organizer creation: $0 price allowed

This implementation ensures free food items are automatically included, clearly displayed, and protected from user modification while maintaining a good user experience.
