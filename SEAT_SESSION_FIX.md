# Seat Selection Session Management Fix

## Problem Description

When users navigated from seat selection to food selection and returned, their previously selected seats were showing as "reserved" and became uneditable. This was because:

1. Seats were only being reserved when "Continue to Checkout" was clicked
2. The `reserveMultipleSeats` function was calling a non-existent backend endpoint (`/reserve-multiple`)
3. When users returned from food selection, their own seats appeared as reserved by "someone else"
4. No proper session-based seat ownership validation was in place

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because:

1. **Incorrect Reservation Timing**: Seats were not being reserved immediately when clicked
2. **Missing Backend Endpoint**: Frontend called `/api/seats/reserve-multiple` which didn't exist
3. **No Session Validation**: The system couldn't differentiate between seats reserved by the current session vs. other users
4. **Inconsistent State**: UI state and backend reservation state were out of sync

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Individual Seat Reservation on Click**
- Modified `handleSeatSelect` to reserve/release seats immediately when clicked
- Added `handleSeatReserve` function to handle individual seat operations
- Users now see immediate feedback when seats are reserved/released

### 2. **Fixed API Integration**
- Updated `reserveMultipleSeats` to avoid calling non-existent endpoint
- Changed "Continue to Checkout" to proceed with already-reserved seats
- Used existing `/api/seats/reserve` and `/api/seats/release` endpoints

### 3. **Enhanced Session Storage Tracking**
- Added `storeSeatReservation` and `removeSeatReservation` functions
- Local tracking of which seats are reserved by current session
- Functions: `isSeatReservedBySession`, `getSessionSeatReservations`

### 4. **Improved Clear Selection Logic**
- `handleClearSelection` now properly releases all reserved seats
- Both backend and local storage are cleaned up
- Graceful error handling if some operations fail

### 5. **Comprehensive Cleanup on Booking Completion**
- Enhanced `clearAllSeatingData` to remove seat-level reservations
- Updated booking completion flow to clear all session data
- Prevents conflicts with future booking sessions

## Key Changes Made

### SeatingLayoutV2.tsx
```typescript
// Seats are now reserved immediately when clicked
const handleSeatSelect = async (seat) => {
  // Reserve/release seat on backend
  await handleSeatReserve(seat, isSelecting);
  
  // Update UI only if backend succeeds
  setSelectionState(newState);
}

// Continue to Checkout just proceeds (seats already reserved)
const handleReservation = () => {
  // No API call needed - seats already reserved
  onSelectionComplete(selectionState);
}
```

### sessionStorage.ts
```typescript
// Track individual seat reservations
export const storeSeatReservation = (eventId, seatId, sessionId) => {
  // Store reservation with expiry
}

export const isSeatReservedBySession = (eventId, seatId, sessionId) => {
  // Check if seat belongs to current session
}
```

### seatingAPIService.ts
```typescript
// Fixed to not call non-existent endpoint
async reserveMultipleSeats(request) {
  // Return success since seats already reserved individually
  return { success: true, message: 'Seats already reserved' };
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Session Persistence**: Users can navigate away and return without losing seats
2. **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate visual confirmation when seats are reserved/released
3. **Proper Session Ownership**: Users can modify their own reserved seats
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if API calls fail
5. **Clean Session Management**: Proper cleanup prevents future conflicts

## User Experience Improvements

- ✅ Users can navigate to food selection and back without losing seats
- ✅ Selected seats remain editable by the same user/session
- ✅ Immediate visual feedback when reserving/releasing seats
- ✅ Clear error messages if operations fail
- ✅ Proper cleanup when booking is completed
- ✅ Toast notifications for all seat operations

## Testing Scenarios

To verify the fix works:

1. **Select seats** → Should see immediate "reserved" feedback
2. **Navigate to food selection** → Return and seats should still be selected/editable
3. **Clear selection** → All seats should be released properly
4. **Complete booking** → All session data should be cleaned up
5. **Start new booking** → No conflicts from previous session

## Development Debug Tools

Added debug functions available in development:
```javascript
// Check current reservations
window.showSeatingStorage();

// Manual cleanup
window.clearSeatingSession(eventId);

// View all seating keys
window.clearAllSeatingData(eventId);
```

This fix ensures users have a smooth seat selection experience with proper session management and persistence across navigation.
