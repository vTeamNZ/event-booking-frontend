# EventHero Cross-Event Contamination Bug Fix

## üö® Critical Issue Resolved
**Problem**: When users clicked on one event, they would see another event's image and information in the EventHero component. This was causing serious confusion in the booking flow where users thought they were booking for a different event.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Faulty Caching in BookingContext
- The `useEventDetails` hook in `BookingContext.tsx` had aggressive caching that didn't properly invalidate when switching between events
- The cache check only verified `eventId` match but didn't clear stale `eventDetails` data
- EventHero component prioritized cached `eventDetails` over fresh navigation state data

### Secondary Issue: Data Source Priority
- EventHero components across all pages were using `eventDetails?.imageUrl` (cached) before `event?.imageUrl` (fresh)
- This meant stale cached data would override correct current event data

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixes Implemented

### 1. BookingContext Cache Fix (`BookingContext.tsx`)
```tsx
// BEFORE (faulty caching):
if (state.bookingData?.eventId === eventId && state.bookingData?.eventDetails?.organizationName) {
  // Already have details for this exact event
  return;
}

// AFTER (no caching - always fetch fresh):
// ALWAYS fetch fresh data - no caching to prevent cross-event contamination
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Eliminates cross-event data contamination
- ‚úÖ Ensures fresh data for each event
- ‚úÖ Prevents race conditions with concurrent API calls

### 2. EventHero Data Source Priority Fix
Updated all pages to prioritize fresh navigation state over cached context:

#### TicketSelection.tsx
```tsx
// BEFORE:
imageUrl={eventDetails?.imageUrl || event?.imageUrl || (state as any)?.imageUrl}

// AFTER:
imageUrl={event?.imageUrl || (state as any)?.imageUrl || eventDetails?.imageUrl}
```

#### SeatSelectionPage.tsx
```tsx
// BEFORE:
imageUrl={eventDetails?.imageUrl || event.imageUrl}

// AFTER:
imageUrl={event.imageUrl || eventDetails?.imageUrl}
```

#### Payment.tsx & PaymentSummary.tsx
```tsx
// BEFORE:
imageUrl={eventDetails?.imageUrl || (state as any)?.imageUrl}

// AFTER:
imageUrl={(state as any)?.imageUrl || eventDetails?.imageUrl}
```

### 3. Context Reset on Page Load
Added booking context reset when loading events to ensure clean state:

```tsx
// Clear any existing booking context to prevent cross-event contamination
if (dispatch) {
  dispatch({ type: 'RESET' });
}
```

## üìÇ Files Modified

1. **`src/contexts/BookingContext.tsx`**
   - Removed faulty caching logic
   - Added race condition protection
   - Always fetch fresh event details

2. **`src/pages/TicketSelection.tsx`**
   - Updated EventHero data source priority
   - Added context reset on page load
   - Fixed organizer name fallback

3. **`src/pages/SeatSelectionPage.tsx`**
   - Updated EventHero data source priority
   - Added context reset on page load

4. **`src/pages/FoodSelectionEnhanced.tsx`**
   - Updated EventHero data source priority

5. **`src/pages/Payment.tsx`**
   - Updated EventHero data source priority

6. **`src/pages/PaymentSummary.tsx`**
   - Updated EventHero data source priority

## üß™ Testing Verification

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Cross-Event Navigation**: Click on Event A, then Event B - verify Event B shows correct image/info
2. **Browser Back/Forward**: Navigate between events using browser buttons - verify correct data
3. **Direct URL Access**: Access event pages directly via URL - verify correct data loads
4. **Cache Busting**: Switch between multiple events rapidly - verify no stale data appears

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ EventHero always shows correct event image
- ‚úÖ Event title, date, location match the selected event
- ‚úÖ Organizer name corresponds to the current event
- ‚úÖ No mixing of data between different events
- ‚úÖ Fresh data loads even when quickly switching events

## üöÄ Impact

### User Experience
- **Fixed**: Users no longer see wrong event information when booking
- **Improved**: Consistent and reliable event data display
- **Enhanced**: Better confidence in booking the correct event

### Technical Benefits
- **Eliminated**: Cross-event data contamination
- **Reduced**: Race condition possibilities
- **Improved**: Data consistency across booking flow
- **Enhanced**: Component reliability and predictability

## üîß Deployment Notes

### Pre-Deployment Checklist:
- [x] All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- [x] No runtime errors in console
- [x] EventHero displays correct data on all pages
- [x] Booking context properly resets between events

### Post-Deployment Monitoring:
- Monitor for any new caching issues
